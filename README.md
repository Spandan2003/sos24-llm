# Summer of Science 24: Large Language Models

## Journey from ML to LLMs

Let's go on a fun journey from the basics of machine learning to the wonders of large language models (LLMs). Imagine we're on an adventure to build a super-smart robot friend named Lexi who can chat with us about anything. Here's how we get there:

### 🤖 Machine Learning (ML) - The Foundation
#### Step 1: Teaching the Robot Basics
Think of machine learning as teaching a robot to learn from examples. For instance, if you want Lexi to recognize apples 🍎 and oranges 🍊, you show it lots of pictures of each, telling it which is which. Over time, Lexi learns to identify apples and oranges on its own by finding patterns in the images.

### 🧠 Deep Learning (DL) - The Brain Power
#### Step 2: Giving the Robot Super Senses
Deep learning is like giving Lexi a powerful brain 🧠 that can handle much more complex tasks. Imagine Lexi now has layers of interconnected "neurons" (like a mini-brain) that help it understand really complicated stuff. For example, instead of just recognizing apples and oranges, Lexi can now recognize different breeds of dogs 🐶 or even tell the difference between various emotions in people's faces 😊😢😡.

### 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Teaching the Robot to Understand Human Language
#### Step 3: Teaching the Robot to Understand Us
Now, we want Lexi to understand and talk to us. This is where natural language processing (NLP) comes in. NLP involves teaching Lexi to understand human language. We start by giving it lots of text to read 📚, like books, articles, and conversations. Lexi learns the meaning of words, grammar, and context. So, when you say "What's the weather like today?", Lexi knows you're asking about the current weather conditions 🌦️.

### 🌐 Large Language Models (LLM) - The Chatty Genius
#### Step 4: Making the Robot a Conversational Expert
Finally, we create a large language model (LLM), which is like giving Lexi an encyclopedia 📖 and a library of conversations 💬 to learn from. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing Lexi to generate human-like text and answer questions in a coherent and context-aware manner.

Imagine you ask Lexi, "Tell me a story about a dragon 🐉." Thanks to the LLM, Lexi can come up with something like:

"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a majestic dragon named Blaze. Blaze wasn't like other dragons; instead of breathing fire, he could summon rainbows 🌈. One day, the kingdom faced a terrible drought, and Blaze's unique gift was their only hope..."

Lexi can weave together an engaging story because it has learned patterns from countless stories and knows how to put together sentences that make sense and are enjoyable to read.  

LLMs seem like magic spells ✨, but remember they were built upon years of hard work and research. To truly grasp LLMs, you'll need to dive into the worlds of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing. But fear not! This isn't mandatory; think of LLMs like TVs 📺. You don't need to understand the inner workings to enjoy the show, but if you want to upgrade the viewing experience of ALL TVs, knowing the basics can help. So, while you're mesmerized by Lexi's chatter, consider delving deeper into these topics for a fuller understanding if not now then later.

## What exactly do all of these terms mean?

## Plan of Action
Alrighty, let's break down the SoS project into three exciting parts: Plan of Action, Mid-term Report, and End-term Report. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you must, because deadlines are looming), is to tackle the Plan of Action first.

Picture this: the Plan of Action is like a treasure map 🗺️ guiding you through the jungle of your project. It's your chance to map out the timeline, plot your course, and decide which juicy topics you're going to uncover along the way.

But fear not, intrepid explorer! You're not alone on this quest. I'm here as your trusty guide, ready to lend a helping hand whenever you need it. Don't hesitate to reach out, brainstorm ideas, or bounce thoughts off me.

Remember, before you set sail on your adventure, you'll need to share your Plan of Action with me for a quick check-up. So, gear up, sharpen your pencils 📝, and let's get ready to embark on this epic journey together! And remember, procrastination is the enemy here, so let's hustle and bustle before the deadline creeps up on us like a stealthy ninja 🥷!
